## Opening an issue

Before creating the issue, make sure that it does not exist (opened or closed).

The main reasons why the issues are created:

1. Report a problem.
2. Ask anything.
3. Suggest changes.

#### Content

Regardless of the purpose it would be nice to provide the following information:

1. **Overview** - *description of what is being treated and try to be clear and objective.*
2. **Use case** - *explain how we can simulate the user's point of view problem.*
3. **Browsers** - *is a problem in all browsers, if not what are they?*
4. **Related issues** - *is there any issue related to the subject?*
5. **Suggest a fix** - *can you suggest a fix to the problem.*

*The issue name should clear what the objective is. It is not necessary to include other information.*

## Submitting a Pull Request

Ensure your Pull Request follow the following guidelines:

1. Make sure there is not the same proposal open, to avoid duplication.
2. Keep the short but descriptive title.
3. Check spelling and grammar.
4. If there is an related issue to Pull Request, mention it in the description.
